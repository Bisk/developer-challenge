# Bisk Public Developer Challenge
Bisk online front end developer challenge.

## Description
The goal of this challenge is to develop as much of the layout of this single landing page as possible utilizing the bootstrap 4+ css framework. Complete as much of this challenge in the shortest amount of time you can from initial checkin to completed project. We would like to see your thinking process, your knowledge of SASS, LESS and/or CSS, and how you would go about developing a form and then use your knowledge of javascript to validate a lead form. You can develop the lead form and validation using any method you choose. The important thing to show is how you would go about putting in place some form of DOM manipulation to display form errors and prevent form submission without validated field information.

The project itself can be developed using your language of choice, HTML, PHP, Node, Ruby, and should be optimized for both Desktop and Mobile view ports.

Resources for the hero image and icons used in the layout are in the resources folder within this project.

Good Luck!!!
